*******************************

To install, extract both the EXE and DLL to your
GIMP plug-ins folder. This is typically at 
C:\Users\<USER>\.gimp-x.x\plug-ins\.

If you prefer, there is also a plug-ins folder in 
your main GIMP installation. This is at 
<install dir>\lib\gimp\2.0\plug-ins\.

To get the latest version of the plugin and download 
source code, visit <http://code.google.com/p/gimp-vtf/>.
