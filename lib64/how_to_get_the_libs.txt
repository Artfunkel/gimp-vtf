You don't need to build GIMP to get LIB files to link against. You can strip the compiled DLLs included in your GIMP installation. Here's what you need:

libgimp-2.0-0
libgimpbase-2.0-0
libgimpui-2.0-0
libgimpwidgets-2.0-0
libglib-2.0-0
libgobject-2.0-0
libgtk-win32-2.0-0
libintl-8

1) Copy each DLL to your gimp-vtf\lib64\ folder
2) Copy the DEF files from the GIMP and GTK+ source packages to the same folder. Get them from:
	ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gimp/v2.8/
	ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.24/ (go for the bundle)
3) [Temporary] The DEF for libgtk is currently missing from the GTK bundle. Follow these instruction to generate one from your DLL:
	http://www.coderetard.com/2009/01/21/generate-a-lib-from-a-dll-with-visual-studio/
4) Rename the DEF files to match the DLLs
5) Open the Visual Studio Command Prompt and run dll_to_lib.cmd
